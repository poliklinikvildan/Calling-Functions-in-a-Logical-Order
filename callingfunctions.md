# Calling Functions in a Logical Order

A brief approach to ensure that Python functions execute in a logical order from top to bottom:

1. **Sequential Calling:** Be sure to call the functions in the order they are defined. This ensures that the functions execute in a top-to-bottom sequence.

2. **Nested Restriction:** Be aware that attempting to call a nested function from the global scope will result in an error, as nested functions are only accessible from within their enclosing outer functions.

## Examples:

**Sequential calling:** Call functions in the order they are defined. This ensures a top-to-bottom execution flow.

**Nested Restriction:** Attempting to call a nested function from the global scope will result in an error, as nested functions are only accessible from within their enclosing outer functions.

### Argumented Examples:

**Example 1: Sequential Function Calls with Arguments**

Sequentially calling functions with arguments ensures both logical order and proper data passing.

def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

def farewell():
    print("Goodbye!")

def appreciate(activity):
    print("Thank you for", activity)

# Call functions in desired sequence with arguments
greet("Alice")
farewell()
appreciate("your help")
Output:

Hello, Alice
Goodbye!
Thank you for your help



**Example 2: Nested Function Calls with Arguments**

Nesting functions allows for encapsulation and logical grouping. However, inner functions are only accessible from within their outer functions.

def outer_function(place):
    print("Welcome to", place)

    def inner_function(time):
        print("It's", time, "here!")

    inner_function("noon")

# Call outer function with arguments
outer_function("Europe")
Output:

Welcome to Europe
It's noon here!

**Conclusion:** By adhering to clear and organized coding practices, such as calling functions in a logical order and understanding the limitations of function nesting, one can maintain readability and ensure the proper execution flow of the code.
